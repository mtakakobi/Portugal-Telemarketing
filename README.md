 ## Problem Statement
The Campaign is used to get user to open a term deposit, but if the marketing team reaches out to every single user it will cost a lot resources. Therefore to increases it's efectifity the marketing team would like to filter and contact only high percentage user to open a term deposit.

## Goals

Not only that the bank would also like to learn what variables that would make the user want to open a term deposit.

After the pattern is found, then we are going to build a classificaion model that will help the marketing team to predict the likelihood of a user to open a term deposit.
